## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hak1998/Inventory__Management__System
   ```

2. Configure the database connection in `appsettings.json`:

   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
         "DefaultConnection": "User ID =postgres;Password=YourPassword;Server=localhost;Database=InventoryDB;Pooling=true;"
   }
   ```

3. Apply database migrations:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project Inventory.Infrastructure
   ```
OR
   ```
   The code will automatically apply any pending EF Core database migrations at runtime â€” typically during application startup.
   ```
